# Online Dynamic Adventure!
Like an old console adventure game, where you decide what to do in the story. But noone has time to make such a story alone! Here you can dynamically add actions and consequences to the story!
## Features
* ASP.NET Core API (restful, kinda)
* Hosted WASM Blazor 
* SQL Server DB accessed through EF Core
